Python_TMP007
=============
Python library for accessing the TMP007 temperature sensor on a Raspberry Pi.

Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit TMP007 pressure sensors ----> https://www.adafruit.com/product/2023

To install, download the library by clicking the download zip link to the right and unzip the archive somewhere on your Raspberry Pi. Then execute the following command in the directory of the library:

sudo python setup.py install

Make sure you have internet access on the device so it can download the required dependencies.

See examples of usage in the examples folder.

Please support Adafruit (though I have no connection to them) and open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!
